- Like Paper is iOS application made by @0si43  
- I cannot satisfied with (Apple)Notes app or Evernote when I wrote something by Apple Pencil. I felt it too much. 
- You could lunch and write by this app. It's very intuitive, minimalistic, essential!
- Technically, Like Paper largely depend on [PencilKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pencilkit). You could see this app as one of the living sample using PencilKit framework(perhaps it's rare).
