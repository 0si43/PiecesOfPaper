- I am not satisfied with the writing experience of Apple Pencil in (Apple)Notes app or Evernote
- I felt I was forced to do so many actions before writing
- By using Pieces of Paper, its user can just launch the app and write
- It's very intuitive, minimalistic, essential!
- Technically, Pieces of Paper largely depends on [PencilKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pencilkit). You could see this app as one of the living examples using the PencilKit framework (perhaps it's rare).
